This repository contains the code of ACI (Ancestral Causal Inference).
Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

ACI is described in an upcoming NIPS 2016 publication:

Sara Magliacane, Tom Claassen, Joris M. Mooij:
"Ancestral Causal Inference", NIPS 2016.

The paper can be also found on arxiv: arxiv.org/abs/1606.07035.

The ASP folder contains various Answer Set Programming encodings of causal discovery algorithms.
The R folder contains most of the code (surprisingly, in R).
The experiments folder contains various Matlab code that we used to plot the evaluation graphs, or run the experiments on the Sachs2005 dataset.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code of ACI builds heavily on the code from the following publication:

Antti Hyttinen, Frederick Eberhardt, Matti JÃ¤rvisalo:
"Constraint-Based Causal Discovery: Conflict Resolution with Answer Set Programming", UAI 2014.

In the NIPS 2016 paper we refer to this implementation as HEJ (from the surnames of the authors).
The original code of HEJ is available at: https://sites.google.com/site/ajhyttin/publications
